# Project Name
Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## General Information
- This project aims to predict the demand for shared bikes using multiple linear regression.
- The background of the project involves addressing the revenue decline of a bike-sharing company due to the COVID-19 pandemic and predicting the demand for shared bikes once the situation improves.
- The business problem is to understand the factors affecting bike demand and develop a model to predict future demand levels.
- The dataset used contains daily bike demand data across various factors such as weather, season, and day of the week.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas - version 1.3.3
- Matplotlib - version 3.4.3
- Seaborn - version 0.11.2
- Scikit-learn - version 0.24.2
- Statsmodels - version 0.13.0
- Numpy - version 1.21.2

## Conclusion
- The top three predictor variables that influence bike bookings are temperature (atemp), year (yr), and weather situation 3 (weathersit_3).
- Temperature has a positive effect on bike rental count, while weather situation 3 has a negative effect.
- Year (yr) shows a positive trend, indicating an increase in bike rentals over time.
- Other factors such as workingday, season, month, and weekday also contribute to variations in bike rental counts.
